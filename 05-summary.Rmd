# Load the data
BitCoin <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shakibed/Final_Project_Group_04/main/BTC-Monthly.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Convert date
BitCoin$Date <- as.Date(BitCoin$Date)

# Convert to time series object
bitcoin_ts <- ts(BitCoin$Close, start = c(as.numeric(format(min(BitCoin$Date), "%Y")), as.numeric(format(min(BitCoin$Date), "%m"))), frequency = 12)


```



### Explanation of the Forecast Table  

```{r}
bitcoin_forecast_fit_model <- Arima(bitcoin_ts,c(0,1,2))
forecast_next_12 <- forecast(bitcoin_forecast_fit_model,h=12)
kable(forecast_next_12, digits = 2, formats="html", row.names = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, font_size = 12, position = "center")
```


The forecast table provides the projected Bitcoin prices for the next 12 months along with their confidence intervals. Here's what each column represents:


  -Point Forecast: This is the predicted value of the Bitcoin price for each month. It's the best estimate based on the ARIMA(0,1,2) model.
  - Lo 80 and Hi 80: These columns represent the lower and upper bounds of the 80% confidence interval. There's an 80% chance that the actual Bitcoin price will fall within this range.
  - Lo 95 and Hi 95: These columns represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval. There's a 95% chance that the actual Bitcoin price will fall within this range.

## Key Insights
  - Steady Price Increase: The point forecast predicts a steady increase in Bitcoin prices from approximately $36,803 in December 2023 to $37,310 in November 2024.
  - Uncertainty Range: The prediction intervals widen over time, indicating increasing uncertainty, with 95% confidence intervals ranging from around $28,451 to $45,154 in December 2023 to $2,952 to $71,669 in November 2024.
  - Moderate Fluctuations: The forecasts suggest moderate monthly fluctuations, with the highest forecasted point in April 2024 and the lowest in March 2024.
